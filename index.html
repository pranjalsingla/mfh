    <h1> My Favourite Hobby <br> Reading Books</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p>
    My favourite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I
started to do it when I was four years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I
kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. I was happy
when I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read a detective story.
I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my
favourite author, J.K.Rowling who writes “ Harry Potter” . There are a lot of
advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new
vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me
an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future. I can learn the different
cultures and customs of other countries in the world too.
 I read at least one hour every day. I read books by myself. I usually read it
at home. I wish I could read different kinds of books because it might be very
challenging.

    <h1>Hi</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p>Reading books is my pastime. Books are my never-falling friends. When I am out of tune with myself, I take recourse to reading books by great writers and masterminds. I have read a number of books. Some books leave a profound influence upon our minds. The book which has appealed to me the most is “My Experiments With Truth”, written by Mahatma Gandhi. It throws a flood of light on his personality and thought. It is ideas and thoughts that have moved the world. This book centers round two things: Gandhiji’s patriotism and his struggle for India’s freedom. He fought against injustice and inequality with the weapons of truth and non-violence. The book brings out how Gandhiji awakened the sleeping Indians with his moral force and aroused in them a love for liberty. The book also points out Gandhiji’s own weaknesses. To him, God was truth and truth was God. He never tried to conceal anything about his life. He believed that politics should be tempered with morality. I like this book because it has proved a turning point in my life. I have learnt a lot from this great book. It remains one of the most precious treasures of mankind. It makes a very good reading. Every sentence of this book has a touch of sincerity. It is written in a simple but effective style. It is worth reading.</p>
